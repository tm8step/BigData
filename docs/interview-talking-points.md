# Interview Talking Points

Use this file to prepare a concise explanation of the project for a technical interview.

## 30-Second Overview

> I built an end-to-end distributed data pipeline using Apache NiFi, HDFS, Hive, Spark MLlib, YARN, and HBase. NiFi ingested the source dataset into HDFS, Hive provided a managed SQL layer, Spark MLlib read the Hive data and trained and evaluated a machine learning model, YARN managed the Spark workload, and Spark persisted the model metrics into HBase. The repository preserves the architecture, code, and execution evidence so the implementation can be reviewed without a live cloud environment.

Rewrite this overview in your own words so it reflects your specific dataset and machine learning implementation.
